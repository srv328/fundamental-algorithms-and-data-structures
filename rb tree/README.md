# Red-Black Tree Implementation in C++

This C++ code implements a Red-Black Tree data structure along with functionalities to manage and manipulate the tree.

## Overview

The code comprises the following key components:

### Data Structures

- **List Element Structure**: Represents a node of a linked list.
- **Tree Element Structure**: Defines the structure of a tree node in the Red-Black Tree.

### Operations

#### Linked List Operations

- **List Initialization**: `list_init()`: Initializes an empty linked list.
- **List Insertion**: `list_insert()`: Inserts a new element into the linked list.
- **List Erasure**: `list_erase()`: Removes an element from the linked list.

#### Red-Black Tree Operations

- **Tree Initialization**: `root_init()`, `null_init()`: Initializes the Red-Black Tree and a null node.
- **Insertion**: `insert()`: Inserts a node into the Red-Black Tree.
- **Deletion**: `erase()`: Deletes a node from the Red-Black Tree.
- **Balancing**: `insert_balance()`, `erase_balance()`: Balances the Red-Black Tree after insertion or deletion.
- **Rotation**: `rightRotate()`, `leftRotate()`: Performs right and left rotations for maintaining the Red-Black Tree properties.

### Visualization

- **Console Output**: The code includes functions to print the Red-Black Tree elements in the console with color coding for better visualization.

## Usage

The `main()` function initializes a Red-Black Tree and sets up the necessary environment. To use the tree operations, you can modify the `main()` function by calling the required functions to insert, delete, or display the Red-Black Tree elements.

This code serves as a demonstration of a Red-Black Tree implementation in C++.

Note: The code provided here lacks the complete implementation and needs additional modifications and user input handling to perform Red-Black Tree operations effectively.
